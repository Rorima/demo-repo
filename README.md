As amazing as it sounds, I still haven't learned how to use Git and Github properly, so I'm here, 
doing another crash course on Git and Github. Hopefully this time I learn how to use both of them
and I can move on to more advanced topics.

[This is the course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) I'm using doing now.
